        An automated feeder that uses computer vision and machine learning to distinguish between different pets in the same household. 
        Each pet is recognized individually, and the system dispenses the right food, ensuring fairness and tailored nutrition.

      <p><strong>Context from Radical Software (1970s):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The radical spirit emphasized decentralization, personalization, and questioning dominant structures.</li>
        <li>Media tools were reimagined as instruments to redistribute agency and provoke reflection.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Applied to our feeder:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>De-standardization:</strong> Recognizes each pet’s species and identity, enforcing appropriate food boundaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Feeding decisions remain with the owner while the system ensures fairness.</li>
        <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Owners manage multi-pet households ethically and fairly.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical provocation:</strong> Embodies personalization and raises questions about equality vs. equity.</li>

        <em>Whenever I gaze at Manhattan from our studio, I see a city in constant flux—shifting sun, changing light, evolving activity. Yet our buildings and products remain rigid, blind to these changes.</em> 
        How can materials be designed to make buildings and products responsive, context-aware, rather than static and rigid.

      <div class="section-title">Intent & Purpose to Radical Prototype</div>
      <ul>
        <li>The radical design spirit emphasizes questioning assumptions, exploring material agency, and creating systems that respond intelligently to context.</li>
        <li>Materials are instruments that sense, respond, and engage with their environment.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Applied to the project:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>De-standardization:</strong> Buildings and products adapt to environmental changes, user behavior, and situational needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Control is shared between the material, environment, and user.</li>
        <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Materials empower designers and users to create adaptive, context-aware systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical provocation:</strong> Embedded responsiveness challenges static design assumptions.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Gesture-Controlled Lamp with Bio-Inspired, Shape-Morphing Shade</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>3D-printed shell with bio-inspired patterns:</strong> The lampshade/shell is printed with natural motifs (e.g., honeycomb lattices, leaf venation, pinecone scales) to modulate diffusion and strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape-morphing shade:</strong> Inspired by biological/natural behaviors, the shade can change form (living hinges, TPU ribs, compliant mechanisms) to widen/focus the beam and vary light quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Gesture control via Arduino + camera/IR:</strong> An Arduino connects to a mini camera or IR/ToF sensor; lightweight CV recognizes gestures (wave, number signs) to toggle power, dim/brighten, and change color temperature/hue.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="section-title">State of Knowledge of the Field</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gesture CV:</strong> Hand-pose/keypoint models can run on an edge host (ESP32/RPi) or classify sensor streams locally.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensing fallback:</strong> IR proximity/ToF ensures reliable “wave” detection in low-light when CV confidence drops.</li>
        <li><strong>Light engine:</strong> Addressable LEDs enable smooth dimming and CCT/RGB mixing; PWM/constant-current drivers manage heat and flicker.</li>
        <li><strong>Fabrication:</strong> PETG/TPU prints support compliant joints and living hinges; parametric CAD eases pattern iteration.</li>
        <li><strong>UX & Safety:</strong> Consider glare (UGR), CRI, thermal paths; include a manual override and status LED.</li>

        <li><strong>De-standardization:</strong> A lamp that adapts its form and output to the situation, not the other way around.</li>
        <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Privacy-preserving, on-device gesture recognition—no cloud dependency by default.</li>
        <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Hands-free control of intensity, color, and beam spread; users compose their ambient light.</li>
